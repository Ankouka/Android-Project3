My app displays a google map and shows the user's current location on the map. The app has two features which are having the user type in a location and click the button, then the map displays the results of the requested on the map. The second feature is if a user clicks on a location on the map, a marker appears to place where the user is currently located and they can click "I'm at this location" button to show their current location. This app is for people who want to know where they are if they are lost or wants call a ride and want to which places they want to go. The problem it solves for users is struggling to find finding nearby restaurants, museums, grocery stores, near your current location. The resources are Github Copilot and Google Maps API, https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/start
